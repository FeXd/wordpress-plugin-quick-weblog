# Quick Weblog
A simple [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) plugin to help facilitate posting to my tech news weblog at https://arlin.org. 

## 📝 Basic Post Format

- **Title** (same as article)
- **Quote**
  - **Image** (absolute URL from article, not storing locally)
  - **Image Credit**
  - **Text** from article (usually only one paragraph)
  - **Citation** (absolute URL for article, link opens in new tab)
- **Category** (typically name of publication)
- **Tags**

## 🤖 Future Automation
This plugin could auto-populate most of the form by scraping the data from article linked in each post. However, I think the manual copy/paste required right now is acceptable and ensure that the article content is read. I'm not looking to fully automate, but that may change in time.
